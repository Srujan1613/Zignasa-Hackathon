## 🔁 How It Works

1. User uploads a PDF resume and enters a target job role
2. Backend extracts resume text and sends a structured AI prompt to OpenAI
3. AI identifies skill gaps & generates a 4-week personalized roadmap
4. Frontend displays animated roadmap cards + a clean dashboard
5. User interacts with the AI chatbot for learning guidance
6. Roadmap adapts as the user checks off weekly tasks
